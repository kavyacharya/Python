1. Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not. Return area.

length=10;
breadth=10
area=length*breadth
print(area);

2. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
radius=10
area=radius*2
print(area)


4. A company decided to deduct pf of 12% of salary if year of service is less than 5 year and 24% employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years.
Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net in-hand salary after pf deduction.
year=7
sal=30000
if(year<5):
    in_hand=sal*100/2
else:
    in_hand=sal*100/24
print(in_hand)



5)A school has following rules for grading system:

    e. 70 to 80 - B+
    f. 80 to 90 - A
    g. Above 90 - A+

Ask user to enter marks for their 5 main subject and print the corresponding grade and overall grade for average of marks.

mark1=30
mark2=40
mark3=70
mark4=50
mark5=90
Total_mark=(mark1+mark2+mark3+mark4+mark5)
average=Total_mark/5

if(average < 40):
    print("F")
elif(40< average < 50):
   print("C")
elif(50< average < 60):
   print("C+")
elif(60< average < 70):
   print("B")
elif(70< average < 80):
   print("B+") 
elif(80< average < 90):
   print("A")
elif(average > 90):
   print("A+")
else
    print("Enter the mark properly")


6. A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.
    Take following input from user

  And print
    percentage of class attended
    Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.

class_held=20
class_attend=10

perc_attend=(class_attend*100)/20
print(perc_attend)

if(perc_attend > 75):
    print("eligible")
else:
    print("No eligible")
